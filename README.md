🧮 Filtered SQL queries to support secure data access, anomaly detection, and investigative queries.

**Project Title**: *Secure Data Access and Filtering with SQL Queries*

**Project Introduction**: This project focused on applying SQL filters to isolate relevant security data from a large dataset, simulating real-world incident data triage.

**Modeling and Evaluation**: Queries included WHERE, LIKE, and JOIN operators. Evaluation was based on filtering accuracy, efficiency, and ability to reduce alert fatigue.

**Conclusion**: Queries enabled quick triage of high-value records. Next steps include incorporating queries into a SOC playbook or alerting system.
